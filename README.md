This project is a distributed, event-driven video processing system that allows users to upload videos, process them asynchronously, and receive real-time updates.  It uses FastAPI (Python) for handling file uploads and WebSockets, RabbitMQ for task distribution, OpenCV &amp; FFmpeg for video processing, and React for the frontend UI.
